**Updates from last time**

I was trying to learn some new things in Swift and Xcode and add some new features to make this Tips Calculator app better. Here is a list of what I did:
•  I changed the overall look and feel to make it more appealing than before. 
•  I added a onboarding modal as a welcome and introducation for first time users. 
•  I learnt spring and fade animations and appied them into the modal.  
•  I added Number of People field and Payment for Each person fields in the app. 
    •  By default, it displays 1. 
    •  If there are multiple people, the user can change it and see the updated Payment Per Person. 

Other things I tried but failed:
•  I tried to hide Payment Per Person when the number of people is 1 (default). 
•  I tried to highlight the whole Number of People field when selected. Found some resources online but none of them worked. 
•  I tried to highlight the whole Number of People field when selected. Found some resources online but none of them worked.
